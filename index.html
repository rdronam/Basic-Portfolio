		<p> My name is Rahul Dronamraju, but I'm sure that anyone who is interested in reading this already knows my name. It is on the header of the website after all. I was born in Scottsdale, Arizona and lived throughout California and Texas. I graduated form University of Houston where I majored in Supply Chain Management. </p>
